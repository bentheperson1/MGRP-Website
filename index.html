       &emsp;&emsp;In our studies, it’s been found that Artificial Intelligence has the power for great good and great malice. <br><br>

       &emsp;&emsp;Students have been observed to cheat on assignments by prompting the AI to answer their work, which they would then take the answer from and pass it off as their own. However, “the chatbots - while sometimes convincing - also give wrong answers.” (Bonos) This is important because when a student prompts an AI for answers to a problem, especially one they don’t know the answer to and is given the wrong information as fact, they will then go on holding that misinformation as the truth, further hurting them in the long run. Students adopting a habit of relying on AI for answers can create a false sense of security and lead to students neglecting the essential skills of developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and situational awareness. Therefore, it’s vital for educators and students alike to AI-powered tools with extreme caution and vigilance.<br><br>

       &emsp;&emsp;Even though “Some students use AI technologies to cheat on assignments, tests, and examinations” and that “AI can facilitate academic dishonesty and has the potential to significantly interfere with students' educational outcomes.” (“Artificial”) It’s been found that “AI systems can also help students get back on track faster by alerting teachers to problems the naked eye cannot see.” (Jimenez and Boser) This would tremendously help customize each student’s learning experience to suit their needs. For example, an AI-powered tool could analyze a given student’s performance and identify areas in which they might be struggling, allowing teachers to provide targeted support and resources to help them improve. This has the potential to help students who are falling behind to get back on track faster, thus leading to better academic performance.<br><br>

       &emsp;&emsp;Along with students being able to cheat on assignments with ease, “Evan Selinger, a philosopher,” is worried “that predictive texting reduces the power of writing as a form of mental activity and personal expression.” (Baron) as it would allow an easy shortcut for students to write whatever they want on the fly without putting any brainpower into what they’re saying or meaning. Doing so would further lessen the power and impact of human writing. <br><br>

       &emsp;&emsp;While most students will adhere to academic honesty and not use AI to write their assignments, “The temptation to lean on editing and text generation tools like Grammarly and ChatGPT makes it all too easy for people to substitute ready-made technology results for opportunities to think and learn.” (Baron) This is a concerning trend as assignments are typically not only meant to assess a student’s knowledge of a subject but also to develop their critical thinking and writing skills. Heavily relying on these technologies can hinder students’ growth in such areas, causing them to miss out on essential learning opportunities.<br><br>

           <strong>Question:</strong> How can AI be implemented in classrooms to provide a better learning environment?<br><br>

           <strong>Answer:</strong> There are various ways that AI can be implemented in classrooms to improve the overall learning environment. For instance, AI can be used to provide personalized learning experiences for students based on their unique needs and interests. “While acknowledging there are "real concerns" around AI, he sees the benefits far outweighing the risks” (Bonos). Even though there are significant risks and liabilities associated with incorporating AI in classrooms, many people believe that the benefits outweigh the possible risks.<br><br>

           In addition, AI can also be used to provide feedback and assistance to students, which can help improve their learning outcomes. “Teachers should be experts in creating their own assessments as well as in using the results of any assessments to customize learning supports for students.” (Jimenez and Boser) With the help of AI, students can receive timely and individualized feedback on their work, allowing them to progress at their own pace. For example, if a student struggles with math but excels in history, the AI could generate a lesson plan to include more math than history subjects or something similar to that.<br><br>

           <strong>Question:</strong> How is AI currently used in classrooms? Is it a positive or negative effect?<br><br>

           <strong>Answer:</strong> The use of AI in classrooms is still relatively new, and there are both positive and negative effects to consider. “Young adults in my surveys appreciated AI assistance with spelling and word completion, but they also spoke of negative effects.” (Baron) For example, some students may become overly reliant on AI tools and may not develop their own problem-solving skills. Students doing so would be extremely detrimental to their long-term success in school and work, as whenever they come up against a problem that can’t be solved with AI, they flounder.<br><br>

           Furthermore, the use of AI in education in any capacity has sparked concerns regarding academic honesty. As “ChatGPT's launch also inspired a debate over the tool's use in education, as students around the world quickly began using the platform to write essays and solve homework problems, sometimes passing off the AI-generated content as their own work.” (“Artificial”) Using AI-powered tools to generate quick answers to their assignments, students are now able to describe the problem they have and just have the AI solve it for them, ultimately destroying academic honesty in the process.<br><br>

           Lastly, many schools already use Artificial Intelligence in a limited capacity, mainly to help grade students’ papers and assignments, even “Most states also currently use natural language processing to score the essay portion of their yearly assessment.” (Jimenez and Boser) Using AI, teachers can save precious time grading papers by simply passing them off to an AI that can grade them based on a supplied rubric. Even though the use of AI is still relatively limited, it has the potential to revolutionize the way teachers interact with students and how they teach overall.<br><br>

        Dear Reader, <br><br> 

        &emsp;&emsp;Artificial intelligence has become somewhat of a buzzword in recent years, seeing the rise of tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and GPT-4, among others. In the past year or so, AI as a whole has become a hotbed for academic dishonesty among students fostering rampant cheating on exams and essays. In this project, I intend to cover the near full extent of AI’s impact on education and learning as a whole. <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;Removing the hype and speculation around it, AI is a field of study in computer science that allows computers to complete tasks that would otherwise be needed to be completed by a human. Some examples of this include grading papers automatically, filtering spam content on social media, and even creating art pieces. Most, if not all, Artificial Intelligence systems use massive amounts of data in order to train the models that power said systems. A major flaw with this approach is that certain biases or stereotypes can be essentially baked into the very fabric of the AI due to the people working on the data adjusting it to fit their personal biases, whether consciously or otherwise. <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;Some people see AI in the classroom as a potential help for teachers, while others see it as a disease that must be irradicated. I personally believe the truth lies somewhere in between these two beliefs, as I’ve seen the good Artificial Intelligence can bring, along with the many disadvantages. Starting off with the obvious, AI makes it extremely easy for students to cheat on whatever assignment they might have by prompting a tool such as ChatGPT to come up with an answer for them, which they then proceed to write off as their own. On the other hand, AI is already being used to assist teachers in their duties, such as automated grading with tools like GradeCam. Some schools are even implementing chatbots into the learning curriculum, such as some private schools in Palo Alto, which are beginning to use Khanmigo to assist in customized teaching experiences tailored specifically for each student.  <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;It’s important to note that even though AI can be extremely useful in education, it’s not a panacea. As mentioned above, there are still many challenges and issues, such as the integrity of academic honesty and general bias, that must be addressed before there can be widespread implementation of AI in classrooms. But just like with any emerging technology with potential benefits to be gained, It’s important to approach it with a critical eye and consider both the benefits and drawbacks before forming an opinion on it. <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;I personally believe that AI could be a great benefit to education, but that can only happen once a solution to rampant cheating and academic dishonesty using AI tools is found. Along with AI’s impact on education, I also have experience with it impacting other areas of my life, such as game development. Using tools such as Midjourney or Github Copilot, people can now create works without ever writing a line of code or painting a single stroke.  <br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Schools are beginning to adopt AI-based tooling into classrooms to assist with teaching and to provide customized learning for each student. Even though AI chatbots have been criticized for giving incorrect information, some companies are developing chatbots for school use. One such company is Khan Academy, which is making Khanmigo, an interactive learning assistant currently being tested in over 500 school districts.<br><br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;ChatGPT has become a pain for teachers to deal with as students keep passing AI-generated work off as their own, further damaging academic honesty. Along with rampant cheating and plagiarism, AI-based tooling ultimately robs students of expanding their creative abilities.<br><br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Artificial Intelligence is a far-reaching field of study in computer science that covers the simulation of human learning and real-time problem-solving. Examples of artificial intelligence include tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and GPT-4. All of these tools rely on massive amounts of data in order to process an input given and return a cohesive answer. As it stands right now, AI can only be narrow, meaning it can only do one specific task and nothing else. The other types of possible AI include general intelligence, which would be a computer having the same intellect as a human, and superintelligence, which would be a form of intelligence far exceeding any human intelligence ever to exist.<br><br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Jimenez, Laura and Ulrich Boser. "Future of Testing in Education: Artificial Intelligence." https://www.americanprogress.org, Sep 21, 2021, https://www.americanprogress.org/article/future-testing-education-artificial-intelligence/. Accessed 13 Apr. 2023.<br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Artificial Intelligence based tooling has started to become more and more integrated with schools and teaching, allowing for customized teaching and learning experiences. This includes natural language processing, which provides for scoring assignments such as essays, and computer vision, which allows for physical assignments to be graded by a computer.<br><br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;With the meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence-based tools such as ChatGPT and the subsequent rampant cheating in schools, many are left wondering: what’s the full extent of AI’s use in schools, and what's next? Many parents are concerned about the integrity of academic honesty as it has the potential to “spit out inaccurate information, enable cheating or provide shortcuts that could hurt students in the long run.” (Bonos) These are all valid concerns and criticisms of the technology and how it’s currently being used by students in classrooms. It’s entirely understandable for parents to be worried about their child falling behind in school due to them not learning material due to them completing assignments using Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Another gripe many parents have with AI tools students use is that “Educators must commit additional time and effort to detect AI-generated assignments and homework, further detracting from their ability to focus on their core duties and placing additional strain on limited education resources.” (“Artificial Intelligence”) As many parents understand that teachers are in short supply nowadays, and any distractions that have the potential to derail teachers’ duties to teach their students are a grave threat to a student's academic success. <br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Some education experts are also raising the alarm bells on AI being used by students to cheat on their assignments, citing concerns that “whether AI, more generally, threatens student writing skills, the value of writing as a process, and the importance of seeing writing as a vehicle for thinking.” (Baron) These experts are mainly concerned with the potential threat of students diminishing the overall power of writing, along with students being able to see writing as a way to express themselves or their ideas. If students were to continue down the path of relying on tools such as ChatGPT, whenever they need to convey their thoughts outside of the normal realm of writing, they get stuck. Another possible scenario is when a student has graduated and is working and is in a situation where they cannot access ChatGPT, they once again become stuck and worse than where they started.<br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;Stepping away from the possible downsides of using AI tools in classrooms, some parents believe that with proper management and tweaking, Artificial Intelligence can be utilized for a positive outcome in classrooms. For example, there could be “Machine learning-based AI tools can be used for a variety of tasks such as monitoring student activity and creating models that accurately predict student outcomes.” (Jimenez and Boser) These tools, to many parents, could provide a better learning environment for their children as they could get reports on what their child might be struggling with and how to help them overcome it. It could also open the doorway for specialized learning pathways tailored to each student’s strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;One company, Khan Academy, is already doing just this with their AI classroom assistant Khanmigo. Among other things, they’ve found that building stronger guardrails for stopping students from scoring free answers is essential as “they might not always function as planned. Those protections include stronger moderation filters than those of ChatGPT” (Bonos) Khanmigo is still in infancy, but is currently being beta tested in select school districts around Palo Alto. <br><br>

          &emsp;&emsp;If one thing is sure, the future of AI in classrooms is still being decided by parents and teachers alike, along with proper procedures and policies regarding AI-generated content being submitted for assignments.<br><br>
